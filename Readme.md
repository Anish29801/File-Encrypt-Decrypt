## 📌 Project Overview

This GUI-based application allows secure file transfer between a client and server with auto-started server features. It maintains a live log window, encrypts files using RSA and AES, and lets users save logs for future reference.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔒 **Secure File Transfer**: AES (data) + RSA (key) encryption.
- 🖥️ **Auto Server Management**: Starts/stops with the GUI.
- 📂 **Dynamic File & Folder Selection**: Choose any file/folder.
- 📜 **Real-time Logging**: Logs connections, transfers, and errors.
- 🧾 **Log to File**: Save logs to timestamped `.txt` files.
- 🧩 **Modular Design**: Interface-based separation (`client`, `server`, `crypto_utils`, etc.)

---

## 📦 Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `pycryptodome` library

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pycryptodome
````

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

1. **Clone or Download** this repository.
2. **Navigate** to the root folder:

```bash
cd secure_file_transfer
```

3. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
pip install pycryptodome
```

4. **Verify structure** as shown in [Project Structure](#project-structure).

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open your terminal inside the project directory.
2. Run the GUI app:

```bash
python main.py
```

### 🖼️ Application Workflow

1. **Choose Folder for Received Files**
2. **Choose Client Download Folder** (optional)
3. **Send File to Server**
4. **View Logs / Save Logs / Clear Log Display**

The server runs in the background and terminates automatically on exit.

## 📂 File Explanations

* **main.py**: Entry point. Tkinter GUI + server auto-start + logging + interactions.
* **server.py**: Implements `IServer`. Handles connections, decryption, and file saving.
* **client.py**: Implements `IClient`. Encrypts and sends file to the server.
* **logger.py**: Implements `ILogger`. Centralized logging with timestamped messages.
* **crypto\_utils.py**: Implements `ICryptoUtils`. AES and RSA operations.
* **Interfaces/**: Contains Abstract Base Classes for `client`, `server`, `gui`, and `crypto_utils`.

## 🧩 Interface Implementation Details

This application uses Python's `abc` module to define clear interfaces for better structure.

| Interface File     | Description                                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Iserver.py`       | `start_server()` and `stop_server()`                   |
| `Iclient.py`       | `send_file()`                                          |
| `Icrypto_utils.py` | AES + RSA cryptographic functions                      |
| `Igui.py`          | GUI state, button control, logging, and file selection |

Each interface ensures that implementations follow a contract, allowing easier testing and scalability.

---

## ✅ Summary

This project showcases a production-style Python GUI application using **AES + RSA encryption**, with real-time logging, auto server management, and clean modular design following interface-based architecture.

> 🛠 Ideal for coursework in **Networks**, **Cryptography**, and **Secure Systems**.
